## 🧠 Concept

**Floor 8** is a **floor-based psychological horror experience**. Players awaken on Floor 8 of a mysterious hotel. Their objective is to **identify anomalies** in the hallway—subtle, disturbing changes in the environment. If a player detects an anomaly and presses the **Anomaly** button in the elevator correctly, they descend a floor. If they are wrong, they return to **Floor 8**.

The goal is to reach **Floor 1**, encountering increasing psychological tension and atmospheric effects along the way.
